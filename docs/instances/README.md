# Adding Your Instance
If you want to make your instance public, here's how you do it.

## Guidelines
Here are the following guidelines:
- URL must not contain any racist, homophobic, transphobic, etc. slurs in the name.
- This *cannot* be a Heroku instance. The list would be clogged with them added.
- Instance must be properly maintained with minimum downtime (short outages are allowed - i.e. updating, maintenance, thunderstorms).

If an instance is gone for more than 10 days, it will *probably* be removed. But don't worry, you can always reapply to be added to
the list. (Unless this happened over 5 times in a year.)

## Submition
If you don't know Github or JSON that well, you can [contact me](https://www.nrmn.top/contact/) to add it for you.

If you do know, all you have to do is fork the project and add your instance to the [instances.json](../../instances.json) file and make a 
pull request. Simple!

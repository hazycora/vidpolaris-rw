# Why is everything low quality?
This can be explained by how YouTube works internally. See, they seperate videos by things called itags.
Itags can have both audio and video, audio only, or video only.

I tried to research why exactly but couldn't exactly find anything.

Anyway, the higher quality videos like in 720p or higher are usually in seperated formats, making it difficult to 
be played in the traditional HTML5 video player without some extra code.

You can try to see if the code works good on your system by going into settings and turning on "SmartQuality".

It's not exactly foolproof and some videos aren't compatible with it. 
I'm working on a better system currently but the only viable way to do this properly for all systems is in programming 
languages I don't know yet.

But in short, if you have a decent phone or a decent PC, it should work by turning on SmartQuality.

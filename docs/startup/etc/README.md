Now that you are ready to start your server, here's how you use it like you would [vidpolaris.tube](https://vidpolaris.tube) or
any other public instance of VidPolaris.

## Using VidPolaris
If you didn't screw with the code or you just came from the [Startup Tutorial](../README.md), you can find it by typing in the URL
[http://localhost:3001](http://localhost:3001).

This isn't accessable outside of your computer as of now and I may add some tutorial for that soon.

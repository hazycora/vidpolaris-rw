## Special Thanks
In no particular order, here are all of my thanks for keeping this project running!

- [Electrohaxz](http://electrohaxz.tk) for making this project possible. Without him, this project would be nowhere.
- [njchaltry](https://github.com/njchaltry) is another inspiration to keep this project going.
- Family and friends for encouraging me to continue this project.
- The awesome package writers who, without them, this project wouldn't even be alive right now.

## Requirements
- NodeJS 10 or higher
- All the required packages ([seen in package.json](https://github.com/n0rmancodes/vidpolaris-rw/blob/master/package.json)).
- Port ``3001`` to be open (or ``8002`` for api only instances).
